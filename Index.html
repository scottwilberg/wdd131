                <p>Utah is a landlocked state in the Mountain West subregion of the Western United States. It borders Colorado, Wyoming,
                    Idaho, Arizona, and Nevada. The state is known for being the headquarters of the Mormon church, hosting the Sundance
                    Film Festival, and being the site of the 2002 Winter Olympics. Utah is famous for its natural beauty, including the
                    Great Salt Lake and five national parks known as ‚Äúthe mighty five‚Äù12. The name ‚ÄúUtah‚Äù is derived from the Ute Native
                    American tribe, meaning ‚Äúpeople of the mountains‚Äù</p>
