                <p>There are a few different soil compositions that work well for raised garden beds.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A 2:1 mix of compost and topsoil works well.</li>
                    <li>If using bags, aim for 2 parts topsoil with 1 part compost.</li>
                    <li>If beds already have soil, add 4 to 6 inches of compost.</li>
                    <li>A good mix includes topsoil, compost, and sand or grit.</li>
                    <li>Equal volumes of peat moss, coarse vermiculite, and compost can also be used.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

        <p>I used the last option mentioned for my soil. I used equal parts peat moss, vermiculite, and compost. And since my beds were 2 feet tall I filled in the bottom with branches that will decompose over time. The compost provides nutrients to the soil, retains moisture, and supplements natural microbes. The vermiculite improves moisture retention, boosts root system development, and enhances aeration. The peat moss aids in seed germination, acts as a natural fertilizer, and adjusts soil pH levels.</p>
        <p>When I plant starts (like tomatoes and peppers) I also add phosphorus to the roots of the plants. After my plants start coming up I add Epsom Salt around the plants, it is an excellent fertilizer and boost plant production and growth.</p>

            <p>Here I attempted to plant my plants in 5 gallon buckets using the same soil composition. Unfortunately, my plants did not do very well and I had to transplant them into a regular garden bed. I believe it was because the heat of the containers was too much for the plants and they ended up burning up. </p>

            <p>For insect control, I use a pesticide that I spread around the bases of each of my garden beds. On the ground below my beds not inside my beds, that provides protection from insects climbing up from below. I also plant marigolds which seems to help, and if you get any natural bug preditors like spiders in your garden, just remmebr they are your friends and let them be.</p>
